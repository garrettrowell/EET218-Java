This is a collection of all of the code that I wrote for my Java class 
last semester (Spring 2012). A few friends of mine expressed intrest in 
learning Java, and since in my opinion you learn programing best by
looking at source code, this repo is for you. This class was my first taste of
Java so by no means am I saying that the way I completed these assignments
is the best possible way, but in the end when all was said and done I walked
out of the class with a 100% - A+. I hope this code can help someone out.

I have included my assignment sheets for every assignment except for Quiz 2. These are what I wrote my programs off of. These documents can be found in for example /Lab3/AssignmentP1.JPG

Best of luck,
Garrett
